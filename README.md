# 🛡️ PhishScan

**PhishScan** is a real-time phishing URL detection system built using Machine Learning. It extracts 30+ handcrafted features from a given URL and uses a trained ML model to classify it as **Safe** or **Unsafe**.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Feature Engineering**  
   The system extracts over 30 features from the input URL including:
   - Presence of IP address  
   - Length of URL  
   - Use of `@`, `//`, `-`, `https`  
   - Number of subdomains  
   - Domain age, and more

2. **Model Training & Selection**  
   - Trained multiple ML models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree  
   - Tuned using GridSearchCV  
   - Best model selected based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

3. **Prediction Workflow**  
   - URL entered via the Streamlit UI  
   - Features extracted using the `ParseFeatures` class  
   - Passed through the preprocessor and trained ML model  
   - Output: **Safe** ✅ or **Unsafe** ❌
